      [ (gogoproto.nullable) = false ];
  // votes contains the votes of the proposal.
  repeated Vote votes = 4;
  // start_ts is the block time that the proposal is set.
  int64 start_ts = 5 [
    (gogoproto.customname) = "StartTS",
    (gogoproto.jsontag) = "start_ts",
    json_name = "start_ts"
  ];
  // result is the result of the finished proposal.
  ProposalResult result = 6;
  // result_meta is the metadata related to the result of the finished proposal.
  string result_meta = 7;
  // finish_ts is the block time that the proposal is set as finished.
  int64 finish_ts = 8 [
    (gogoproto.customname) = "FinishTS",
    (gogoproto.jsontag) = "finish_ts",
    json_name = "finish_ts"
  ];
  // status is the status of a proposal.
  ProposalStatus status = 9;
}

// ProposalResult is the enum type for the proposal result.
enum ProposalResult {
  // unchosen value
  PROPOSAL_RESULT_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  // approved
  PROPOSAL_RESULT_APPROVED = 1;
  // rejected
  PROPOSAL_RESULT_REJECTED = 2;
  // expired
  PROPOSAL_RESULT_EXPIRED = 3;
}

enum ProposalStatus {
  // unchosen value
  PROPOSAL_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED = 0;

enum ProposalVote {
  // unchosen value

  // pubkeys_change_count is the pubkeys change proposals count.
  uint64 pubkeys_change_count = 1;
}
```
