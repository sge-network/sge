# **Concepts**

Bet module is tasked with placing bets and settling them too.

The user can place bet on a same sport event multiple times with different or equal odds.

> Bet Placement will be done using a ticket containing odds info signed by a trusted source. Verifying this ticket will be done in the placement state itself.

> Bet amount can not be less than a minimum amount which is defined for each sport event. A predefined global value is default for this.

> Also, a betting fee has been defined for each sport event, a predefined 
> global value is default for this.

Before accepting bet some checks should be done:
- In sport event level:
    - Event is active for bet placement
    - Event is not already resolved or cancelled
    - Maximum cap for sport-event has not already reached (based on bet 
      amount deducted by betting fee)
    - Bet amount (deducted by betting fee) is not less than the minimum allowed bet amount
- In SR level:
    - Maximum bet placement cap of SR has not reached
- In DVM level:
    - All data provided in placement request is valid e.g. odds value
- KYC Validation:
    - If KycRequired is true in bet ticket payload, then the status of kyc approval should be true and tx signer and kyc id should be same for a bet to be placed
    - If KycRequired is false, then kyc validation is not required and bet can be placed without kyc check

When a bet is accepted:
- Corresponding betting fee will be deducted from total bet amount
- Betting fee will be transferred to the module account of bet module
- The rest of bet amount will be transferred and locked in Strategic Reserve module

For bet placement user can raise a request to place a single bet, or raise a request to place multiple bets at a time as a bet slip. Also, the same for bet settlement, it can be done for a single bet, or for multiple bets.

When a user is raising a transaction to place a bet, the creator of the transaction is the owner of the  bet. But in the case of bet settlement transaction, creator of the transaction can be different from owner of the bet, means that anyone can raise a settlement request for any bet.

> Bet settlement is not going to be done automatically in Blockchain, a transaction needs to be done to settle bets, by the owner or by anyone else on the behalf of user. In this TX payout is done and fund is transferred from Strategic Reserve to bettor's account.
