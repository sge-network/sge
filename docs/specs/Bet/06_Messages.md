# **Messages**

In this section, we describe the processing of the Bet messages.

## **MsgPlaceBet**

Within this message, the user specifies the bet information they wish to place.

```
// PlaceBet defines a method to place a bet with the given data
  rpc PlaceBet(MsgPlaceBet) returns (MsgPlaceBetResponse);
```

```
// MsgPlaceBet defines a message to place a bet with the given data
message MsgPlaceBet {
  // creator is the bettor address
  string creator = 1;

  // bet is the info of bet to place
  BetPlaceFields bet = 2;
}

// PlaceBetFields contains necessary fields which come in BetPlacement and BetSlipPlacement TX requests
message BetPlaceFields {
  // uid is the unique uuid assigned to bet
  string uid = 1 [(gogoproto.customname) = "UID" ,(gogoproto.jsontag) = "uid", json_name = "uid"];

  // amount is the wagger amount
  string amount = 2 [
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Int",
    (gogoproto.nullable)   = false];

  // ticket is a signed string containing important info such as `oddsValue`
  string ticket = 3;
}

// MsgPlaceBetResponse is the returning value in the response of MsgPlaceBet request

## **MsgSettleBet**

Within this message, the user provides a bet UID they wish to settle its corresponding bet.

```
// SettleBet defines a method to settle the given bet
  rpc SettleBet(MsgSettleBet) returns (MsgSettleBetResponse);
```

```
// MsgSettleBet defines a message to settle the given bet

  string creator = 1;

  // bet_uid is the unique uuid of the bet to settle
  string bet_uid = 2;
}

  - Empty bet UID
- Bet UID in invalid
- There is no matching bet
- Bet is canceled
- Bet is already settled
- Corresponding sport event not found
- Result of corresponding sport event is not declared
- There is an error in SR module functions

### **What Happens**
- If corresponding sport event is aborted or canceled, the bet will be updated in the `bet module's KVStore` as below:
    ```
    bet.Result = types.Bet_RESULT_ABORTED
    bet.Status = types.Bet_STATUS_SETTLED
    ```
- Resolve the bet result based on the sport event result, and update field `Result` to indicate won or lost, and field `Status` to indicate result is declared.
- Call `Strategic Reserve module` to unlock fund and payout user based on the bet's result, and update the bet's `Status` field to indicate it is settled.
