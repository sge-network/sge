# SGE Network

The Sports, Gaming & Entertainment Network (SGE Network), is a blockchain 
designed to support the future of sports betting & related gaming by 
leveraging the modular Cosmos design. We believe the future will be heavily shaped by many of the values driving the recent wave of crypto and blockchain development: transparency, increased decentralization, and utility that benefits all stakeholders, especially the user-base.

Utilizing a sovereign blockchain uniquely enables: 
- An adaptable framework to design custom applications.
- Enablement of features, tools and economic models where users can directly benefit from the value they help create.
- An unparalleled level of transparency.
- An efficiency of settlement and immediate payout to participants. 

At launch, the SGE Network will be optimized to deploy an inaugural application: Six Sigma Sports, which is re-imagining the sports betting landscape and bringing a unique user experience with the benefit of blockchain technology.[Please visit to learn more about Six Sigma Sports.](https://sixsigmasports.io/)

## Installation Steps
>Prerequisite: go1.18+ required. [ref](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Sge could be installed by two ways - downloading binary from releases page or build from source.

### Download from releases page
* Download from release required binary

* Check sha256 hash sum

* Place sged into /usr/local/sbin
```shell
sudo mv sged /usr/local/sbin/sged
```


### Building from source
>Optional requirement: git. [ref](https://github.com/git/git)

>Optional requirement: GNU make. [ref](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html)


* Clone git repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/sge-network/sge.git
```
* Checkout release tag
```shell
cd sge
git fetch --tags
git checkout [vX.X.X]
```
* Install
```shell
go mod tidy
make install
```

### Install system.d service file
```shell
nano /etc/systemd/system/sged.service
```
Please following contents(working dir may be changed as needed)
```
[Unit]
Description=Sge Network node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ubuntu
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/sged start
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
LimitNOFILE=40960

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Reload unit files in systemd
```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Generate keys

`sged keys add [key_name]`

or

`sged keys add [key_name] --recover` to regenerate keys with your [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0039) mnemonic

### Connect to a chain and start node
* [Install](#installation-steps) sge application
* Initialize node
```shell
sged init {{NODE_NAME}} --chain-id sge-network-1
```
Select network to join
* Replace `${HOME}/.sge/config/genesis.json` with the genesis file of the chain.
* Add `persistent_peers` or `seeds` in `${HOME}/.sge/config/config.toml`
* Start node
```shell
sged start
```

## Network Compatibility Matrix

| Version | Mainnet | Testnet | SDK Version |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
|  v0.0.1 |    ✗    |    ✓    |   v0.45.4   |


## Active Networks

### Mainnet

Coming Soon!!

### Testnet

- [sge-network-1](https://github.com/sge-network/networks/sge-network-1)


* Place the genesis file  with the genesis file of the chain.
```shell
wget https://github.com/sge-network/networks/blob/master/sge-network-1/genesis.json -O ~/.sged/config/genesis.json
```
Verify genesis hash sum
```shell
sha256sum ~/.sged/config/genesis.json
```
Correct sha256 sum for sge-network-1 is - 2bea72699f9c1afd6217f7e76f14f07c1fbe849d090fc37cd008a42d14d5d30c
Genesis file sha sum is published in according repository.

* Add `persistent_peers` or `seeds` in `${HOME}/.sge/config/config.toml`
```shell
sed -i '/s/persistent_peers = ""/persistent_peers = "4980b478f91de9be0564a547779e5c6cb07eb995@3.239.15.80:26656,0e7042be1b77707aaf0597bb804da90d3a606c08@3.88.40.53:26656/g' $HOME/.sge/config/config.toml
```
* Start node
```shell
sged start
```

### Initialize a new chain and start node
* Initialize: `sged init [node_name] --chain-id [chain_name]`
* Add key for genesis account `sged keys add [genesis_key_name]`
* Add genesis account `sged add-genesis-account [genesis_key_name] 10000000000000000000usge`
* Create a validator at genesis `sged gentx [genesis_key_name] 10000000usge --chain-id [chain_name]`
* Collect genesis transactions `sged collect-gentxs`
* Start node `sged start`

### Reset chain
```shell
rm -rf ~/.sge
```

### Shutdown node
```shell
killall sged
```

### Check version
```shell
sged version
```
